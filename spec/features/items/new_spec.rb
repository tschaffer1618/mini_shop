# As a visitor
# When I visit a Merchant Items Index page
# Then I see a link to add a new item for that merchant
# When I click the link
# I am taken to '/merchants/:merchant_id/items/new' where I see a form to add a new item
# When I fill in the form with the item's:
# - name
# - price
# - description
# - image
# - inventory
# Then a `POST` request is sent to '/merchants/:merchant_id/items',
# a new item is created for that merchant,
# that item has a status of 'active',
# and I am redirected to the Merchant Items Index page where I see the new item
